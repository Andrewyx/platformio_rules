# A blinking LED

The most classic electronics example, blinking an LED, is an example of an
Arduino project.

This project has no inputs, and only uses one output to blink the LED.

## The circuit

### On Arduino Nano
You don't need to connect anything, the Arduino Nano has an internal LED
connected to the right pin

### On Arduino Mega
